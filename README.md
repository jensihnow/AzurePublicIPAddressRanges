# AzurePublicIPAddressRanges

![last-commit] ![issues-raw] ![issues-pr-raw] ![repo-size]

## Introduction

This repo tracks the changes made to the official Azure IP Address Range list available on [https://www.microsoft.com](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=56519). This list is published by Microsoft once a week and includes Compute, SQL and Storage ranges used in the Microsoft Azure Datacenters.

## About

As Azure is only keeping the current state it becomes hard to track changes over time. Comparing a saved state with a current state can be done using the publication time, as long as you have a previous file saved.

This repo is updated once a day if updates had been published. This allows to track all changes over time for comparison.
